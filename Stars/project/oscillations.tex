\section{Types of Oscillations}

Oscillations with $m=0$ that satisfy the dispersion relation
\ref{eq:dispersion} would lead to short wave-lengths oscillations,
which are not interesting, since they can't be observed. Therefore
oscillations of interest would be either \textbf{global} or
\textbf{trapped}. Global oscillations are low frequency and
one armed $m=1$. If $n=0$ they are an eccentric deformation of the 
disk plane, while the $n=1$ are a corrugation wave.

\subsection{Eccentric deformations of the disk}

The dispersion relation for $m=1$ and $n=0$ is:

\begin{equation}
(\omega - \Omega)^2 - \kappa^2 = k_r^2c_s^2
\end{equation}

and it reduces to:

\begin{equation}
\omega \sim - \dfrac{1}{2} \Omega \left( \dfrac{k_r
c_s}{\Omega}\right)^2
\end{equation}

The $m=1$ perturbation is
