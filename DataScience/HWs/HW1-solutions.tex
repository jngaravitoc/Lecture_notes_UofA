1. Given a stream of symbols $a_1,a_2,…,a_n$ each an integer in
$1,…,m,$ give an algorithm that will select one symbol uniformly
 at random from the stream. How much memory does your algorithm require?

\end{mdframed}

\textbf{Solution:}\\

A random probability to select a given symbol of the stream
would be $P = \dfrac{1}{n}$ where $n$ in the number of symbols in the
stream. If we are reading one symbol at a time, the probability of
reading the symbol $j$ would
be $P = \dfrac{1}{\sum j}$ where $j$ is the index of the symbol. Therefore 
the probability of selecting the symbol $j+1$ is $P_{j+1} =
\dfrac{1}{\sum (j+1)}$.\\

2. Give an algorithm to select an $a_i$ from a stream of symbols
$a_1,a_2,…,a_n$ with probability proportional to $a^2_i$.\\
\end{mdframed}

\textbf{Solution:}\\


In this case the probability of selecting the symbol $a_j$ of the stream 
would be $P = \dfrac{1}{S_{j}}$ where $S_j = \sum a_j^2$.

3. How would one pick a random word from a very large book where the
probability of picking a word is proportional to the number of
occurrences of the word in the book? \\
\end{mdframed}

\textbf{Solution:}\\

Keep track of the appearances of each element and the probability is
going to be $P = \dfrac{1}{\sum  }$
